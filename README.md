# ðŸ¤– BuggyRobot-RaspBerryProject

This project is a Raspberry Pi-controlled buggy robot using the gpiozero library. The robot can move forward, backward, left, and right, with adjustable speed, and is controlled via a keyboard interface using the curses module.

Features

Forward, backward, left, and right movement

Adjustable speed (Low, Medium, High)

Status logging to status.txt

Graceful shutdown command

Hardware Requirements

Raspberry Pi (tested on Pi 5)

L298N Motor Driver

2 DC motors

Power source (12V battery recommended)

Male-to-female jumper wires

Wiring Diagram

Motor Driver Pin

Status Logging

The robot's current status (movement direction and speed) is logged in status.txt.

Troubleshooting

Motors Not Moving?

Check wiring connections.

Ensure motor driver is powered properly.

Run gpioset commands to test individual GPIO states.

Only One Motor Works?

Swap motor connections to confirm if the issue is wiring-related.

Ensure both ENA and ENB are powered or controlled via PWM.

No Key Presses Detected?

Run robot.py with sudo.

Add print(f"Key pressed: {char}") in the loop to debug key inputs.
